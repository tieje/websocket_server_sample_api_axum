# websocket_server_sample_api_axum
Practicing creating a websocket API server built with Axum.

## Usage

## Resources
- https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/extract/ws/index.html

## TODO

- [ ] figure out how to test the websocket
  - [ ] perhaps the best way to test is to set up two servers that communicate with each other such as in a game of ping pong
- [ ] make a blog post about websockets in Axum Rust
